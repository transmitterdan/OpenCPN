 * How to use:                                                            *
 *                                                                        *
 * To create a filter object declare on instance of iirfilter. There are  *
 * 2 optional parameters to the constructor. The first (Fc) determines    *
 * the filter cutoff frequency. A value of 0.5 is basically no filtering  *
 * and smaller values decrease the cutoff frequency. If you think of the  *
 * filter as being "fast" or "slow" then 0.5 is fastest and smaller values*
 * are "slower". The second parameter (tp) selects whether the underlying *
 * filtered values represent a linear value (such as speed) or a circular *
 * angle such as direction. The angle can be either in radians or degrees.*
 * These values can be changed on the "fly" with the setFC() and setType()*
 * methods.                                                               *
 * The main method is filter() which accepts a new unfiltered value and   *
 * returns a fitered value. To obtain the most recent filter output use   *
 * the get() method. Lesser used methods are getType (returns tp) and     *
 * getFC() (returns FC). The reset() method resets the filter to zero.    *
