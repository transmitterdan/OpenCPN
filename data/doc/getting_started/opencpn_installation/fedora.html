<p>
Using Linux repositories, an easier way to install and update.

<p>
Installing in a different, easy way. RPM
</p>

<p>
<b>Installing on Fedora </b> A full repo is now available and can be used to install and update opencpn.<br/>

To install the repo, please run this as root:
</p>
<pre class="code">dnf install [[http://je.onfray.fr/repo/fedora/23/x86_64/jeo-release-1.2-1.fc23.noarch.rpm|http://je.onfray.fr/repo/fedora/23/x86_64/jeo-release-1.2-1.fc23.noarch.rpm]]</pre>

<h3>Install above RPM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
You can install the above <b>rpm</b>, no matter if you&#039;re using i386 or x86_64, be it Fedora 22 or Fedora 23, it&#039;ll work on all these (you should be able to install it right from your browser clicking the above link and then install)<br/>

By default, only the stable repo is enabled ; you can install opencpn-4.2 from your favorite package manager (dnf, Gnome package kit or KDE package kit).
</p>

<p>
I&#039;ve created two separate packages:
</p>

<p>
<b>opencpn</b> with the program and the two default plugins<br/>

and<br/>

<b>opencpn-doc</b> with the whole html doc to browse it offline.
</p>

<p>
When a new stable is released, you&#039;ll be automatically notified and able to updateâ€¦ so easy!<br/>

<h3>OpenCPN for OpenSUSE and Fedora</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
From Dominig,<br/>

I keep a precompiled version of OpenCPN for OpenSUSE and Fedora ready to install in the OpenSUSE build system (OBS). As both distro are rpm based, it&#039;s very easy for me to suport both.<br/>

<br/>

Getting the correct wx release built and installed is a pain as notonly you need to get the right version built, but you also need to compile it with the right option set (no stl) and then make sure that the system does load what you want. Getting the right wx installed may require to change some priority or even wx repo manually on the target PC.<br/>

<br/>

My OpenSUSE wiki page is here.<br/>
