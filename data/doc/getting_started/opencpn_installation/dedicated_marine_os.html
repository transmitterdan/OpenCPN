<p>
There are people who buy boats but there are also people who build them, why not build your own electronics too? OpenPlotter is a combination of software and hardware to be used as navigational aid on small and medium boats. It is also a complete home automation system onboard. It works on ARM computers like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi</a> and is open-source, low-cost and low-consumption. Its design is modular, so you just have to implement what your boat needs. Do it yourself.

<p>
You will need the basic parts and some optional parts. It will depend on what kind of data you want to collect, process or display and what kind of equipment your boat already has.
