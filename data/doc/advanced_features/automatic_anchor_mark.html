<p>
Automatic Anchor Mark.  This is what it does. If the following are ALL true:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"> In “Cruising” mode, meaning that speed has at some point exceeded 3.0 kts.</li>
<li class="level1"> Current speed is less than 0.5 kts.</li>
<li class="level1"> OpenCPN has been up at least 30 minutes</li>
<li class="level1"> OpenCPN is exiting normally</li>
<li class="level1"> There is no anchor watch set on an “anchor…” icon mark.</li>
<li class="level1"> Any “Anchorage - icon” waypoint within 0.25 NM of current GPS location is deleted.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Then, OpenCPN will drop a waypoint at the current location, with the name - “Anchorage created on [Date Stamp]”.
</p>

<p>
Thus waypoints are automatically created for known good anchorages as you shut down the computer.
The 0.25 NM condition prevents clogging up frequently visited anchorages with closely spaced waypoints.
The other conditions help to prevent spurious waypoints.
</p>

<p>
To use this feature find opencpn.conf or opencpn.ini as it is called in windows.
Search for a line like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">AutoAnchorDrop=0 </pre>

<p>
and change the value from “0” to “1”.
