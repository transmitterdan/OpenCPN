</p>

<p>
Use the F6 key for dimming and SHIFT + F6 to reverse the dimming.<br/>

This is not connected to a chart feature, and dims the whole display, not just OpenCPN.<br/>

“CTRL + G” cycles through (monochromatic) green, red and normal screen. The color change applies to the whole screen as well.<br/>

“Ctrl + G” may not work on some Windows systems, depending upon the graphics driver implemented.
</p>

<p>
When pressing F6 the word “MAX” appears on the screen in the NW part. Press again and the screen gets a bit dimmer and “MAX” is replaced by a “9” and so on.

“Print Screen” refuses to catch the dimming!!
</p>

<p>
<b>Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X</b> users can easily adjust the screen brightness with the F1 and F2 keys.

<h3>Change Color Scheme</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
This Button <img src="../opencpn/manual/colscheme.h.32_tok.1ec6ce_w.32.png" class="media" alt="" width="32" height="32" />has 4 levels corresponding to standard US raster charts built in levels. You can cycle through the levels also by pressing the F5 key.<br/>

These represent the Default level, the Daylight level, the Dawn or Dusk level, and finally the Night level.
</p>

<p>
Often there is no difference between the Default level and the Daylight level.
</p>

<p>
The way this button works differs between different categories of charts.
</p>

</div>

<h3>S57 Vector Charts and the CM93 ver2 charts.</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
All charts display the Dawn/Dusk and Night levels. This means that there is no change when the button is first pressed, but further pressing brings up a Dusk and then a Night palette.
</p>

</div>

<h3>US Raster Charts</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
These are generally coded with all the levels. The Daylight level has slightly sharper colors for better daylight viewing.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Other Raster Charts</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Most other raster charts just contains a standard palette, and pressing the Button has no effect other than dimming part of OpenCPN, except for the chart display.<br/>

The Brazilian Raster Charts include a Dusk and Night palette, but the colors displayed are not what one would expect.<br/>

Charts converted with the help of tiff2bsb or imgkap, normally only contain the default color scheme.
