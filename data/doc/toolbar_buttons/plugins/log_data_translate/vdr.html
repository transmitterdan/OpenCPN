<ul>
<li class="level1"> Use VDR for AIS Simulation - Run VDR to play AIS NMEA files. Or… use the VDR plugin to record your passages and replay them later! The VDR is also great for testing NMEA sentences, the Dashboard and new OpenCPN features. These are just a few examples, of how to use this versatile plugin.</li>
<li class="level1"> When VDR is activated in ToolBar→Options→Plugins→VDR, two Buttons appears in the ToolBar</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="level1"> The left button is for recording, and leads to a “Choose file” dialog to select the file to record to. A file with a .txtfile extension works well.</li>
<li class="level1"> The right button is for playing an existing file, and also leads to a dialog where the file must be selected. Once selected VDR starts to play the file,the smalldialog below shows on the screen.</li>
<li class="level1"> <img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/vdr/vdr-control.png" class="media" alt="" /></li>
<li class="level1"> You can control the speed with the upper slider.  Far left is slow, natural speed, while moving the slider to the far right equals fast forwarding.</li>
<li class="level1"> The lower part of the dialog shows the progress.</li>
<li class="level1"> When recording, the VDR plugin includes all NMEA data available on the internal bus in OpenCPN. Even data not recognized or used by OpenCPN will be recorded.  Everything (almost) in the ToolBar→Connections→NMEA debug window will be included.</li>
<li class="level1"> In other words. The VDR records everything from all ports and does not participate in the downstream multiplexer filter or priority scheme. That way, a VDR recording may be played back, experimenting with various filters and priorities if desired.</li>
<li class="level1"> If you are playing a file with the VDR at the same time, even that datawill be included.  So it is possible to play and record at the same time!</li>
