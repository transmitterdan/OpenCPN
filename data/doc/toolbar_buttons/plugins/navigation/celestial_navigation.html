<h3>Plugin to record Sextant Sights and show Circles of Position to obtain a Fix</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Celestial navigation support makes it possible to establish your position when other means are not available. Also, users may find this plugin, which is still under development, useful for cross checking their position fixes obtained in other ways, or to to better visualize a celestial fix. You find the forum thread here:  <a href="../../../lib/exe/fetch.php?tok=5588d4&amp;media=http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/celestial-navigation-plugin-redux-98748.html" class="media mediafile mf_html" title="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/celestial-navigation-plugin-redux-98748.html">Cruisersforum thread: celestial navigation plugin</a>

<h4>Types of Observations</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Currently 3 types of observations are, more or less,  supported:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"> <b>Altitude</b>  (sextant measurement) – Measure the angle between the horizon and a heavenly body, and enter the required data in the plugin. Each measurement results in a Circle of Position on the sphere (COP, or Circle of Equal Altitude). Two or more observations result in intersecting COP&#039;s from which a position fix can be obtained.</li>
<li class="level1"> <b>Azimuth</b>  (compass measurement) – Measure the azimuth (bearing) of a heavenly body. This method is hopelessly inaccurate, especially on a small boat in high seas. However, it is interesting for demonstration purposes, and possibly - with accurate digital compasses - it may be a viable navigation method in the future.</li>
<li class="level1"> <b>Lunar distance </b> (sextant measurement) – Measure the angle between two heavenly bodies. The computer then attempts to determine clock error from this measurement, and the system time may be corrected.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="level2">

</div>

<h4>1. Obtaining Sights with Sextant</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Standard practice in navy and merchant navy with regard to celestial positioning is as follows (assuming no artificial horizon is available on the sextant):
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"> During morning nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take 6 star/planet observations.</li>
<li class="level1"> In the morning at about 09:00LT: take a Sun&#039;s observation (later to be shifted to noon-time).</li>
<li class="level1"> At local noon: take a Sun&#039;s observation (traditionally only direct latitude calculation from sun at meridian passage). Construct a fix for noon from both sun observations.</li>
<li class="level1"> During evening nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take 6 star/planet observations.</li>
<li class="level1"> Use the Moon for an observation in above practice when situation permits.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Many books have been written about the art and science of celestial positioning (see below).
</p>

<p>
This is the document containing the test data used for the example below: <a href="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/celestial_navigation/textbook_data.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="opencpn:manual:plugins:celestial_navigation:textbook_data.pdf (14.6 KB)">Example worksheet</a>(4 star observations).
</p>

</div>

<h4>2. Sight Properties - Sight Tab - Enter Star Data</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Enter Type (Altitude, Azimuth, Lunar), Celestial Body, Limb, Measurement and Degrees of Certainty. Degrees of Certainty is the accuracy the navigator assumes for the observation. A larger value results in a larger line width for the Circle of Position on the chart.
</p>

<p>

</p>

</div>

<h4>3. Sight Properties - Date and Time Tab</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Enter Date (based on GMT/UT) and Time in GMT/UT, Certainty and Shift. Note that entering a shift removes the calculated numerical fix. This is due to the computation method used, which presently does not allow to shift COP&#039;s. However, a position fix can be established by visually observing the COP&#039;s (which are graphically shifted) on the chart.

</p>

</div>

<h4>4. Sight Properties - Config Tab - Display Characteristics</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Enter Transparency and Color you wish to use for the COP.
</p>

</p>

</div>

<h4>5. Sight Properties - Parameters Tab</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Enter Eye Height, Temperature, Pressure and Index Error.

</p>

</div>

<h4>6. Sight Properties - Calculations Tab</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Showing the input figures and some calculated results for the observation. Together with the calculated numerical position fix showed in the main window of the plugin, this can be used for comparison with results that are obtained by other calculation methods (traditional manual method using logarithms, traditional or direct computation methods as mentioned in Nautical Almanac, shortened methods using e.g. <a href="http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_st=&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&amp;pubCode=0013" class="urlextern" title="http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_st=&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&amp;pubCode=0013" rel="nofollow">US Pub. 229</a> or <a href="http://thenauticalalmanac.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://thenauticalalmanac.com/" rel="nofollow">US Pub. 249</a>, other computer applications).

</p>

</div>

<h4>7. Celestial Navigation Sights - Circles of Position and Sights</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
A Circle of Position (COP) indicates all the positions on earth where a navigator may observe the same altitude of a heavenly body at a certain time. Using traditional methods, only the part of a COP the navigator is interested in is used, and replaced by a tangent line (LOP).

</p>

</div>

<h4>8. Four Circles of Position (showing DR position as MOB and fix as Waypoint)</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The MOB icon shows the initial DR position entered. The red circle indicates the intersection of the crossing red lines, the calculated position fix. Hover cursor over the crossing, right click and place a mark. If required, visually adjust this to get best latitude and longitude of the fix. In Sight Properties - Sight Tab, Degrees Certainty was set to 0.05.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<div class="level2">

</div>

<h4>General Traditional Theory</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
A general, but very clear text on celestial positioning is available in the PDF file on the web site of Henning Umland:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> <a href="http://www.celnav.de/page2.htm" class="urlextern" title="http://www.celnav.de/page2.htm" rel="nofollow">A Short Guide to Celestial Navigation (pdf 5mb)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Many thanks to Henning Umland for this concise text. Naturally, also the information provided by the Nautical Almanac and Bowditch is of interest (see &#039;Links&#039;).
</p>

</div>

<h4>Plugin Computation Methods</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The plugin is still under development and the computation methods used are innovative and based on vector, matrix and least squares methods. The author, Sean d&#039;Epagnier, uses this innovative method to directly calculate a fix position. Only he knows the background and details.
</p>

<p>
General information on direct computation methods can be found on pages 277 to 285 of the Nautical Almanac 1994 (see &#039;Links&#039;) and in the following articles:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> <a href="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/celestial_navigation/cel_nav_new_computational_methods_04_2014_01_2_.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="opencpn:manual:plugins:celestial_navigation:cel_nav_new_computational_methods_04_2014_01_2_.pdf (1.7 MB)">New Computational Methods for Solving Problems of the Astronomical Vessel Position (pdf 1.7mb)</a></li>
<li class="level1"> <a href="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/celestial_navigation/cel_nav_direct_fix_v44n1-2.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="opencpn:manual:plugins:celestial_navigation:cel_nav_direct_fix_v44n1-2.pdf (1 MB)">The Direct Fix of Latitude and Longitude from two observed Altitudes (pdf 1mb)</a></li>
<li class="level1"> <a href="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/celestial_navigation/cel_nav_generic_03_2012_06.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="opencpn:manual:plugins:celestial_navigation:cel_nav_generic_03_2012_06.pdf (435.5 KB)">Genetic Algorithm for Solving Celestial Navigation Problems (pdf 435kb)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Presently, the plugin is not capable of advancing COP&#039;s to a common time. When a shift is entered, the calculated numerical position on the main window disappears. In this case, the fix can only be established by visual examination of the graphics on the screen (see also 3. Sight Properties - Date and Time Tab, and 8. Four Circles of Position) and a fix time cannot be established.
</p>

</div>

<h4>Comparison of Plugin Astronomical Data and Nautical Almanac Data</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The data and formulae contained in the Nautical Almanac form a standard in itself. The plugin utilizes astronomical data from VOP87d (for the planets and indirectly for the sun), ELP2000/82 (for the moon) and contains Right Ascension (RA; star&#039;s SHA = 360° - star&#039;s RA) and Declination (Dec) data for the selected stars.
</p>

<p>
During development of the plugin, the calculated (intermediate) correction values for dip, refraction, horizontal parallax, parallax in altitude and semi diameter, as well as the calculated position fix, should be compared to values that result from other computation methods.
</p>

<p>
The astronomical data used in the plugin is more accurate than data taken from the Nautical Almanac. However, for navigation purposes the differences are generally not important. With regard to altitude reductions, so far test data indicates that the differences found in calculated observed altitude (Ho) are small. Measurement and reading errors made by the navigator will be larger. Using the present version, calculated fix positions can still differ from those calculated with traditional methods.
</p>

</div>

<h4>Accuracy of Plugin Astronomical Data</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The plugin astronomical data are from Jean Meeus&#039; Astronomical Algorithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Meeus" class="urlextern" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Meeus" rel="nofollow">Wikapedia</a> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astroalgorithms/" class="urlextern" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astroalgorithms/" rel="nofollow">Sourceforge</a>.

The estimated maximum error in the geocentric longitude is about 10 arc-seconds.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4>Accuracy of Data in the Printed Nautical Almanac</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The largest error that can occur in GHA and declination of any body other than the Sun or Moon is less than 0.2&#039;; it may reach 0.25&#039; for the Sun and 0.3&#039; for that of the Moon. In practice it may be expected that only one third of the values of GHA and declination will have errors larger than 0.05&#039;, and less than one tenth will have errors larger than 0.1&#039;.
</p>

<p>
The errors in the altitude corrections are nominally in the same order (but the actual values of dip and refraction at low altitudes may differ considerably in extreme atmospheric conditions).
</p>

<p>
Depending on the type of sextant, the reading accuracy of the sextant can be 0.2&#039;, 0.1&#039; or 10“. Measurement and reading errors made by the navigator will be larger.

ABSTRACT <br/>
In this work, we employ a genetic algorithm, from the field of artificial intelligence, due to its superior search ability that mimics the natural process of biological evolution. Unique encodings and genetic operators designed in this study, in combination with the fix principle of celestial circles of equal altitude in celestial navigation, allow the rapid and direct attainment of accurate optimum vessel position. Test results indicate that this method has more flexibility, and avoids tedious and complicated computation and graphical procedures.

ABSTRACT <br/>

This work presents a direct method for obtaining the latitude and longitude of an observer from the observed altitudes of two celestial bodies. No assumed position or dead-reckoned position or plotting is required. Starting with the Greenwich hour angles, declinations, and observed altitudes of each pair, the latitude and longitude of the two points from which the observations must have been made are directly computed. The algorithm is presented in the paper, along with its derivation. Two different, inexpensive, programmable pocket electronic calculators were programmed to execute the algorithm, and they do it in under 30 s. The algorithm was also programmed to run on a personal computer to examine the effect of the precision of the calculations on the error in the results. The findings show that the use of eight decimal places in the trigonometric computations provides acceptable results.

ABSTRACT <br/>

In this paper, a simplified and direct computation method formulated by the fixed coordinate system and relative meridian concept in conjunction with vector algebra is developed to deal with the classical problems of celestial navigation. It is found that the proposed approach, the Simultaneous Equal-altitude Equation Method (SEEM), can directly calculate the Astronomical Vessel Position (AVP) without an additional graphical procedure. The SEEM is not only simpler than the matrix method but is also more straightforward than the Spherical Triangle Method (STM). Due to tedious computation procedures existing in the commonly used methods for determining the AVP, a set of optimal computation procedures for the STM is also suggested. In addition, aimed at drawbacks of the intercept method, an improved approach with a new computation procedure is also presented to plot the celestial line of position without the intercept. The improved approach with iteration scheme is used to solve the AVP and validate the SEEM successfully. Methods of solving AVP problems are also discussed in detail. Finally, a benchmark example is included to demonstrate these proposed methods.

ABSTRACT <br/>

Although many mathematical approaches to the celestial fix problem have been published, all of them fundamentally assume a stationary observer. Since this situation seldom occurs in practice, methods have been developed that effectively remove the observer&#039;s motion from the problem before a fix is determined. As an alternative, this paper presents a development of celestial navigation that incorporates a moving observer as part of its basic construction. This development allows recovery of the information on the vessel&#039;s course and speed contained in the observations. Thus, it provides the means for determining, from a suitable ensemble of celestial observations, the values of all four parameters describing a vessel&#039;s rhumb-line track across the earth: latitude and longitude at a specified time, course, and speed. In many cases, this technique will result in better fixes than traditional methods.

ABSTRACT<br/>

A direct method for obtaining the two possible positions derived from two sights using the  vector  analysis  instead  the  spherical  trigonometry  is  presented.  The  geometry  of  the  circle of equal altitude and of the two body fixes is analyzed, and then the vector equation for simultaneous sights is constructed. Also the running fix problem is treated. Finally the C++ source code for the algorithm is provided in an easy implementation, susceptible for being translated to other common programming language

Abstract <br/>

“By the standards of modern astrometry, the earth is quite a wobbly platform from which to observe the sky. The earth&#039;s rotation rate is not uniform, its axis of rotation is not fixed in space, and even its shape and relative positions of its surface locations are not fixed. For the purposes of pointing a telescope to one-arcsecond accuracy, we need not worry about shape and surface feature changes, but changes in the orientation of the earth&#039;s rotation axis are very important. ”
