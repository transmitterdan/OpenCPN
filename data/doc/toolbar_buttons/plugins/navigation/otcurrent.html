<h2>1. What and Why</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The OpenCPN standard installation has tidal current data for the USA. By pressing the &#039;Show Currents&#039; icon  a set of arrows for the tidal current are displayed and also the rate of the current. These arrows are in a single colour. No value for direction is shown.
</p>

<p>
oTCurrent allows the selection of a different date/time for the current prediction. Also, using the &#039;Next&#039; and &#039;Previous&#039; buttons the user can &#039;step through&#039; the time of the prediction.
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT: </b>The times selected/shown use the same time zone as your computer. The tidal current displayed should be checked against official publications.
</p>

</div>

<h2>2. Install</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Download the oTCurrent_pi.dll plugin file and place this file in the plugins folder of OpenCPN. The plugin assumes that you are using the &#039;Harmonic.idx&#039; file installed in the &#039;tcdata&#039; folder of your setup. The plugin is not able to work with &#039;tcd&#039; files.

</p>

<p>
While the &#039;Options&#039; screen is open user preferences can be set. The user can decide whether text values of rate and direction are shown against the tidal arrows. Arrows can be &#039;solid fill&#039; or &#039;outline&#039;. &#039;Fill Colour&#039; makes the arrows &#039;solid fill&#039;.
</p>

<p>
The color of the arrows can be changed. These selections are saved in the Config file.
</p>

<p>
After enabling the plugin and pressing &#039;Apply&#039; the oTCurrent icon appears on the toolbar.

<h2>5. FAQ</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
<b>No arrows are shown.</b> How do I show them?<br/>

Is the chart zoomed in to a sufficiently large scale? Are you using a &#039;Harmonic.idx&#039; file?
</p>

<p>
<b>My sailing area is Europe.</b> Can tidal currents (streams) be displayed?<br/>

Unofficial &#039;Harmonic.idx&#039; files are available for some European waters.
