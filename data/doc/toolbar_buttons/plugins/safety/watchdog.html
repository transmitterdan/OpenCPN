<h1>What is Watchdog (WD) Plugin?</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Watchdog Plugin is a plugin for OpenCPN. This plugin is developed by Sean D&#039;Epagnier and implements various configurable alarms alerting the user about the changing conditions round the boat. Watchdog also implements a Deadman-alarm and an improved anchor alarm. Watchdog communicates with another very useful plug-in, called <b>OpenCPN</b> <b><a href="../navigation/ocpn_draw.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:navigation:ocpn_draw">oDraw</a></b><b>Plugin</b>“. That plugin is a tool to draw points, lines and shapes within OpenCPN. These points, lines and shapes can be used in navigation, for instance to show electronic bearing lines (EBL), variable range markers (VRM), specific points (boundary-points) and specific areas (boundaries). The oDraw-plugin can also be used to create a special type of boundary, called a Guard Zone. These features of the oDraw-plugin can be used in Watchdog. Watchdog can be set up to alert you when your own ship either enters (or gets too close to) or leaves (or gets too far away from) one or more of these boundaries. Watchdog can also be set up to alert you when another ship (AIS-target) enters a boundary.
</p>

<p>
<b>Watchdog</b> will be referred to as <b>“WD-pi”</b> or <b>“WD”.</b> <br/>

<b>OpenCPN Draw Plugin</b> will be referred to as <b>“Draw-pi”</b> or <b>“OD”</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note: the plugin originally started life as “Watch<b>man</b>” but was later renamed to “Watch<b>dog</b>”. The original name “Watchman” might still pop-up in some screens and menu&#039;s.

<h3>What does Watchdog do?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Watchdog warns you -in a couple of specific situations- when you want to be warned.
</p>

</div>

<h3>In what situations can Watchdog warn me?</h3>

<p>
Watchdog has (in the version stated in the top of this document) the following types of alarms:

</ul>

</div>

<h3>How does Watchdog alert me?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Does it bark?
</p>

<p>
Yes, that is possible. But maybe you want to choose something else.
</p>

<p>
You can set an alert in the form of a text-message that pops up on your screen …. (and yes, in that pop-up screen there&#039;s still evidence of the original name Watch<em>man</em>..)
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-02.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
A text-message is rather useless if you are not looking at your display. As the Deadman alarm is supposed to prevent you from falling asleep (or to wake you up if you did) the only logical kind of alert for “Deadman” is some form of (loud and bloody annoying!) noise.
</p>

<p>
So Watchdog also enables you to set an acoustic alarm.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-03.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
You can use any sound you like, as long as it is a <b>”.wav“ file.</b>
</p>

<p>
Examples:<br/>

If you want to brush up on your Morse-code, you can set Morse-code YYY (Yankee = “My anchor is dragging”) as sound for anchorwatch-alarm and Morse-code UUU (Uniform = “You are running into danger”) as the sound for Boundary and Land-fall-alarm. You can generate these sounds yourself dead-simple on the website <a href="http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html" class="urlextern" title="http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html" rel="nofollow">Morse Code Translator</a>. Just type whatever you want, adjust pitch and speed to your liking and save as .wav files in /OpenCPN/sounds).
</p>

<p>
If your only reaction to hearing the beeps of Morse code is “Ah, the pizza in the microwave is ready!” then maybe a more direct approach suits you better. Like for instance a computer that actually says “<b>Warning! Boundary!</b>” when the Boundary-alarm sounds and “<b>Warning! Anchor!</b>” when your anchor is dragging.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-04.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
And if you really want a Watchdog that barks, well….. then find yourself a wav-file of a barking dog (not recommended though; if you are anchored in an idyllic harbour it might start every dog in the surrounding to join in).
</p>

<p>
Apart from pop-up screens and all kinds of sounds, you can also let Watchdog execute a <b>computer command.</b>  That can be any computer command. To name just a few options: Start a pdf-document with pre-defined messages in “Seaspeak” or any other language you need to have a conversation with the skipper of that monstrosity that is about to collide with you.
</p>

<p>
Or imagine your boat anchored in the bay and you sitting ashore in the pub…..
</p>

<p>
And hey, on our mobile phone we receive an email from a loved-one!
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-04b.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
How this email-trick is done, is explained in “<b><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#email_to_yourself" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">Email to yourself</a></span></b>” at the end of this manual.

<h3>Standard actions: Setting up a Watchdog Alarm</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Once you have Watchdog installed and in your OpenCPN Toolbar, follow these 4 initial steps to set up a new Watchdog Alarm:
</p>

<p>
Step 1. Click “<b>Watchdog</b>” in the OpenCPN Toolbar
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-05.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 2</b>. The “Watchdog Window” opens. It will show all the alarms you have set (in this example none is set yet). Click “<b>Configuration</b>”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-06.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 3</b>. The “Watchdog Configuration Window” opens. Click “<b>New</b>”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-07.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 4</b>. The “New Alarm Window” opens. It shows the various types of alarms.
</p>

<p>
(The next steps involve clicking the desired alarm and clicking “<b>OK</b>”)
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-08_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: These 4 initial steps are the same for each alarm. In the rest of this tutorial these steps will not be repeated but will be referred to as “set up a new Watchdog-alarm”.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Standard actions: Setting up the Alarm Actions</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
When setting up a new Watchdog-alarm, you will come across the “Edit Alarm” window.
</p>

<p>
In that window there is a part that is specific for that type of alarm, but also a part that is the same for every type of alarm. It is the “Alarm Action” part.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-alarmaction.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In this part you can tell Watchdog what you want it to do. A brief explanation:
</p>

<p>
<b>Sound</b><br/>

Alert you by playing the soundfile (.wav-file) you have entered (use the “<b>Browse</b>” button to point WD to that file).
</p>

<p>
<b>Command</b><br/>

Execute a computer command (type the command in the box next to “command”).
</p>

<p>
<b>Message Box</b><br/>

Show a pop-up Textbox with “ALARM”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Repeat Alarm after seconds</b><br/>

Gives the opportunity to order WD to repeat the alarm after a set time (in this example that time is set to “60 seconds”).
</p>

<p>
<b>Automatically Reset</b><br/>

Means that when the alarm is triggered, the alarm will be reset to await the next “cause for alarm”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Graphics Enabled</b><br/>

Means that WD will show you something on screen, relating to the alarm. For instance the radius of the anchor-alarm you have set.
</p>

<p>
<b>Test</b><br/>

Means that you can test if the alarm works yes or no.
</p>

<p>
<b>Information</b><br/>

Means that … well, try that button for yourself and you&#039;ll see.
</p>

<p>
If you do not understand the function of the buttons “<b>OK</b>” and/or “<b>Cancel</b>”: sell your computer!
</p>

<p>
First the various types of alarms are briefly explained. After that each type of alarm is explained in (a bit) more detail.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Landfall Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Landfall Alarm is meant to alert you when you are nearing land. Not very usefull when you are only sailing withing a couple of miles from your marina but more aimed at the bigger trips involving vast stretches of water. Columbus would have liked it. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#landfall_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">LANDFALL ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Boundary Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
See <b><a href="../plugin_messaging.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:plugin_messaging">Plugin Messaging between ODraw, Watchdog and Weather_routing.</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Boundary Alarm is meant to alert you when the position of a ship relative to a boundary (or to a boundary of a specific type) is not what you want it to be. For instance when you are about to sail into a so-called “restricted area”. Boundary Alarm can be configured in relation to your distance to a boundary (Boundary  <b>Distance</b>) or in relation to the time it will take you to get to a boundary (Boundary <b>Time</b>). Boundary Alarm can also be set up as  <b>Anchor Watch</b> alarm or as <b>Guard Zone</b> alarm.
</p>

<p>
A Boundary alarm of the type <b>Anchor Watch</b> is meant to alert you when your own ship gets outside a specific boundary. In other words, when your anchor drags. Anchor Watch is related to the position of your own ship and is fed by the data from your <b>GPS</b> receiver.
</p>

<p>
A Boundary alarm of the type <b>Guard Zone</b> is meant to alert you when one or more other ships are inside a specific boundary. “Guard Zone” alarm is triggered by the data from your  <b>AIS</b> receiver.
</p>

<p>
The difference with the “normal” AIS alarm (warn me when a ship comes within a given distance from “own ship”) is that the Watchdog Boundary Guard Zone alarm gets triggered when a ship enters a specific area (like for instance the entrance to that secluded spot you thought to have for just you and your spouse/friend/secretary/…).
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#boundary_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">BOUNDARY ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

<p>
Note: in Watchdog you can set a “Guard Zone” alarm but in oDraw you can also create a “Guard Zone”. A Guard Zone in oDraw is a special kind of area that is not static, but moves with your own ship. The more extensive description is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#dynamic_guard_zones" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">DYNAMIC GUARD ZONES</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Anchor Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Anchor Alarm is meant to alert you when your position changes more than a specific distance from a certain position (in short: when your anchor is dragging).
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#anchor_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">ANCHOR ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Course Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Course Alarm is (of course) meant to alert you when you get off course. The problem with getting off course is that you might end up somewhere where you do not want to be (see “Boundary Alarm”).
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#course_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">COURSE ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Speed Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Speed Alarm is meant to alert you when you are going slower than a certain set speed (<b>Underspeed</b>) or when you are going faster than a certain set speed (<b>Overspeed</b>).
</p>

<p>
If you go too slow, you might run out of beer before you reach your destination. If you go too fast, your lovely sailing trip might end too soon in some lousy marina.
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#speed_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">SPEED ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Deadman Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Deadman Alarm is meant to alert you (or your crew) when the program suspects you to have fallen asleep, jumped overboard or simply passed away. In other words: when after a given amount of time the program still has not experienced any input whatsoever from anyone. The object is of course to be sure there is still someone on board keeping watch and able to take all the necessary actions. The Deadman alarm stops as soon as any user action is taken, for instance a movement of the cursor (mouse).
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#deadman_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">DEADMAN ALARM</a></span></u>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>NMEA Data Alarm -in short</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
NMEA Data Alarm is meant to alert you when OpenCPN loses NMEA-input. NMEA-data is information the program receives from various instruments. Most well-known NMEA-data is from GPS receivers and AIS receivers. NMEA Data Alarm is crucial if you want to rely on anything that has something to do with either your position, course and speed or the position, course and speed of other ships! In short: if you lose your NMEA input, you lose a very important part of the CPN-bit of OpenCPN!
</p>

<p>
The more extensive description of the alarm is here: <u><span class="curid"><a href="watchdog.html#nmea_data_alarm" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:safety:watchdog">NMEA DATA ALARM</a></span></u>.

</p>

</div>

<h3>LANDFALL ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
 <br/>
Landfall-alarm is meant to alert you when you get within a set distance from land.
</p>

<p>
For most sailors the usefulness of such an alert is obvious.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-09.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
“<b>Hoorah and up she rises!</b>” More info: go to ”<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-accident-investigation-branch" class="urlextern" title="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-accident-investigation-branch" rel="nofollow">MAIB</a>“ and search for “Lysblink Seaways”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b>: the alarm operates in relation to the coastline as it is programmed into your vector charts! OpenCPN comes with a worldwide background map, displayed if no charts are available for an area.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: these two screenshots illustrate that the coastline in that basic background map can be quite different from the real thing!
</p>

<p>
Looking at this basic coastline chart WD will assume we are not close enough to the coastline to trigger the Landfall alarm. So, WD stays quiet.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-10.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
When he really should have barked!
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-11.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Therefore it would be advisable to use <b>the most detailed GSHHS High Resolution Background Map</b> which is 224 mb when unzipped and can be downloaded by clicking this link: <b><a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=opencpn:files:charts:gshhshires.zip" class="urlextern" title="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=opencpn:files:charts:gshhshires.zip" rel="nofollow">gshhshires.zip</a></b>.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Unzip the file and make sure these 6 files<br/>

<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_19056_gshhs-01.jpeg" class="media" title="watchdog_19056_gshhs-01.jpg" alt="watchdog_19056_gshhs-01.jpg" /><br/>

</p>

<p>
are placed in a folder called <b>gshhs</b>.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Put that folder gshhs in the directory where OpenCPN is installed (in Windows probably “C:&gt;Program Files (x86)&gt;OpenCPN”).<br/>

</p>

<p>
Restart OpenCPN.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Now that&#039;s more like it!
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-12.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Stay on the safe side and set landfall-alarm for a distance well offshore. Landfall-alarm is not meant for close-quarters navigation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Setting the Landfall-alarm</b> is explained step-by-step by these screenshots.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick “Landfall”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-13_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Click “OK”. The “Edit Alarm” window pops up. In the Edit Alarm window you can choose between “GPS course crosses land in less than … minutes”  or “GPS fix is less than …. nm from coastline”.
</p>

<p>
Here we&#039;ve chosen “GPS fix is less than 5 nm from coastline”. Tick the rest of the boxes and click “OK”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-14.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The Watchdog Configuration window shows the alarm.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-15.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Now your Landfall alarm is ready to be used.
</p>

<p>
Just make sure the “Alarm On/Alarm Off” box is ticked (set).
</p>

<p>

<h3>BOUNDARY ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Watchdog communicates with another very useful plug-in, called <b>“OpenCPN ODraw Plugin”</b>. That plugin is a tool to draw geo-referenced points, lines and shapes within OpenCPN. These points, lines and shapes can be used in navigation, for instance to show specific points or areas (Boundaries), electronic bearing lines (EBL) and variable range markers (VRM). <b>Watchdog</b> will be referred to as “WD-pi” or “WD”. <b>OpenCPN Draw Plugin</b> will be referred to as “Draw-pi” or “OD”.
</p>

<p>
To fully benefit from the capabilities of the WD Boundary Alarms, you have to understand the “Boundaries” made by OD. Therefore, prior to explaining the WD Boundary Alarms, we first give an explanation of these Boundaries (for a full explanation, see the chapter <a href="../navigation/ocpn_draw.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:navigation:ocpn_draw">OCPN Draw</a> chapter in this manual).
</p>

<p>
<b>Boundary Shapes or Boundary Points</b><br/>

You can create Boundaries by using OD. You can create Boundaries in OD by drawing shapes (lines from point to point) but also by drawing just one point (Boundary Point or BP) and then specifying a certain radius (range) around that point.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-18.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Boundary Types</b><br/>

In the “Boundary Properties” tab you can assign a “Boundary Type” to each Boundary or BP. You can choose “<b>Exclusion</b>”, “<b>Inclusion</b>” or “<b>Neither</b>”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-19.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>:  <b>In WD you can set the alarm for every kind of boundary</b>. So, you can set alarms that get triggered when you get in (or too close to) a boundary of the type “Exclusion” but you can also set
alarms that get triggered when you get in (or too close to) a boundary of the type “Inclusion” or a boundary that is of type “Neither”.
</p>

<p>
<b>The most logical thing to do though, is to use as a rule that each Boundary Type is meant to give you a specific type of message.</b> We advise you to use “Inclusion” boundaries as “OK to get in”, “Exclusion” boundaries as “not OK to get in” and “Neither” boundaries as boundaries that are just good to be aware of. The type of message each boundary type would send to you, would then be something like this:
</p>

<p>
Boundary Type <b>Exclusion</b> says: <em>“Don’t you come near me (and “inside me” is an absolute NoNo!)”</em>.  <b>KEEP BOAT OUT.</b><br/>

Boundary Type <b>Inclusion</b> says: <em>“Stay with me, please”</em>. <b>KEEP BOAT INSIDE.</b><br/>

Boundary Type <b>Neither</b> says: <em>“Hey, I don’t care where <u>you</u> are, but I think you should know <u>I</u> exist”</em>.
</p>

<p>
Each Boundary Type is graphically represented in a specific way.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> <b>Exclusion:</b> a hatched pattern <b>inside</b> the area.</li>
<li class="level1"> <b>Inclusion:</b> a hatched zone on the <b>outside</b>of the boundary.</li>
<li class="level1"> <b>Neither:</b> <b>no</b> hatch (just a line).</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can give boundaries any shape, size and color you like, but colorwise it might seem logical to use something reddish (“danger”) for boundaries of the type “exclusion” and something greenish (“safe”) for boundaries of the type “inclusion”.
</p>

<p>
In this screenshot we show you the different types of boundaries.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> Top row: two boundaries of the type “inclusion”</li>
<li class="level1"> Second row: three boundaries of the type “exclusion”</li>
<li class="level1"> Third row: two boundaries of the type “neither”</li>
<li class="level1"> Fourth row: three boundary points. From left to right, “inclusion”, “exclusion”and “neither”.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<b>WD-Boundary Alarms</b><br/>

In WD you can set “Boundary”-alarms (choose “Boundary” in the “New Alarm”-window).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-21_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Boundary Alarm: “Distance” or “Time”</b><br/>

In the “Edit Alarm”-window you can choose between:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> trigger the alarm when my position (GPS fix) is less than …….. nautical mile from the boundary. (GPS fix). This type of alarm is a “Boundary-<b>Distance</b>” alarm.</li>
<li class="level1"> trigger the alarm when my present course and speed will bring me at the boundary in less than …… minutes (GPS course). This type of alarm is a “Boundary-<b>Time</b>” alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you choose “Boundary-Distance”, you can type how many nautical miles you want as a margin from the boundary. 3.000000 means 3 nautical miles, 0.01 means one hundredth of a nautical mile (= 0.01 x 1852 = 18.52 meter) etc.
</p>

<p>
In this screenshot “Boundary-Time” is ticked. You can set the time by typing or by clicking the UP and DOWN buttons.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-22.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: as from WD version 1.9025 the “Edit Alarm” window for Boundary alarm also shows a slider to allow the user to select the frequency of checking.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-slider.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
It defaults to 3 seconds (the current Watchdog default), but can be set from 1 to 120 seconds. The longer the check the better for low powered machines. <b>Note: some screenshots in this manual are not updated with that slider yet!</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Boundary Alarm: “Boundary Type”</b><br/>

You can set a WD boundary-alarm that gets triggered:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> in relation to <b>any </b>boundary, no matter what the type is (the alarm works for all boundaries).</li>
<li class="level1"> in relation to <b>all </b>boundaries of the type <b>Exclusion </b> (the alarm works for all “Exclusion” boundaries)</li>
<li class="level1"> in relation to <b>all </b>boundaries of the type <b>Inclusion </b> (the alarm works for all “Inclusion” boundaries)</li>
<li class="level1"> in relation to <b>all </b>boundaries of the type <b>Neither </b> (the alarm works for all “Neither” boundaries)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-23.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
If you set a WD Boundary Distance-alarm for <b>Any</b>, the alarm will be triggered as soon as you enter a boundary of the type “Inclusion”, “Exclusion” or “Neither”.
</p>

<p>
If you set a WD Boundary Distance-alarm for <b>Exclusion</b>, the alarm will be triggered as soon as you enter a boundary of the type “Exclusion”. The alarm will not be triggered when you enter a boundary of the type “Inclusion” or “Neither”.
</p>

<p>
If you set a WD Boundary Distance-alarm for <b>Inclusion</b>, the alarm will be triggered as soon as you enter a boundary of the type “Inclusion”. The alarm will not be triggered when you enter a boundary of the type “Exclusion” or “Neither”.
</p>

<p>
If you set a WD Boundary Distance-alarm for <b>Neither</b>, the alarm will be triggered as soon as you enter a boundary of the type “Neither” (but it does <b>not </b>work for Boundary Points of type “Neither”, see note). The alarm will not be triggered when you enter a boundary of the type “Inclusion” or “Exclusion”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>:<br/>

BD alarm “Any”, “Exclusion” and “Inclusion” also work in relation to Boundary Points (BP).<br/>

BD alarm <b>Neither </b>does <b>not </b>work for <b>Boundary Points</b>  of type “<b>Neither</b>”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Boundary Alarm: “Anchor Watch” or “Guard Zone”</b><br/>

You can also set a boundary-alarm that gets triggered in relation to a specific boundary (the alarm works only for that specific boundary). That can be an alarm of the type “<b>Anchor Watch</b>” or an alarm of the type “<b>Guard Zone</b>”.
</p>

<p>
Anchor Watch
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-24.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Guard Zone
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-25.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
A Boundary alarm of the type “<b>Anchor Watch</b>” is meant to alert you when your own ship gets outside a specific boundary. In other words, when your anchor drags. Anchor Watch is related to the position of <b>your own ship</b>  and is fed by the NMEA-data from your <b>GPS</b> receiver.
</p>

<p>
A Boundary alarm of the type “<b>Guard Zone</b>” is meant to alert you when one or more other ships are inside a specific boundary. “Guard Zone” is related to the position of <b>other ships</b>  and is fed by the NMEA-data from your <b>AIS</b> receiver. <b>NOTE</b>: “other ships” are only ships that actually transmit AIS data and whose AIS-data are actually received by your AIS receiver! Ships that do not transmit AIS-data (or AIS-data your AIS receiver does not receive) are not “seen” by WD! <b>Keep this in mind, especially as you might encounter ships that <u><em>should</em></u> send out AIS-signals, but don&#039;t do so because their transmitter is switched off on purpose (like fishing vessels that want to keep their favourite fishing tracks hidden from others!)</b>.   
</p>

<p>
To let WD know what specific boundary it should watch, you have to specify the “<b>GUID</b>”. GUID stands for “globally unique identifier” and is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software. GUIDs are displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits with groups separated by hyphens. <br/>
Example: 2a980000-5098-4787-ac4f-e05b47e7ffff
</p>

<p>
To enter the GUID of a Boundary or BP in WD, you place your mouse-cursor on a boundary and copy-paste in the field Boundary GUID or Guard Zone GUID.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-28.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, when the “own ship” icon is within the boundary, you can click “<b>Get Boundary GUID</b>”.<br/>

<b>Note</b>: this method does not always work. In such cases: use the “copy-paste” method.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
When it comes to alarms in relation to boundaries, the most obvious situations where you want an alarm are <b>exclusion </b>boundaries and <b>inclusion</b>  boundaries. In this documentation we&#039;ll focus on these two types.
</p>

<p>
Here you see four boundary-area&#039;s: two Inclusion (top row, greenish) and two Exclusion (bottom row, reddish). The boat is not inside a boundary.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-31.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>SETTING UP A WATCHDOG “BOUNDARY- <u>DISTANCE</u>” ALARM</b>.<br/>

As said before, you can set up a “Boundary-<b>Distance</b>” alarm. That means “trigger the alarm when my position (GPS fix) is less than …….. nautical mile from the boundary”.
</p>

<p>
You can can set the alarm to be triggered:
</p>

<p>
<b>A</b>. as soon as you get <b>within a specific distance from</b>a boundary. That option would result in the alarm being triggered as soon as you get within that distance of a boundary, so you will be warned even before you enter that boundary.
</p>

<p>
<b>B</b>. as soon as you get <b>inside </b>a boundary.
</p>

<p>
We will first give an example of type A and then give an example of type B.
</p>

<p>
<b>A. Creating a Watchdog Boundary Distance alarm “you are <u>to close</u>  to a boundary” (nearer than …. nm”).</b><br/>

In this tutorial we will first set up a Watchdog Boundary Distance Alarm alarm for when we get nearer than a defined distance from a boundary. In this example we will use a limit of 1 nm.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick “Boundary”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-32_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Edit the alarm so that the alarm will be triggered when the GPS fix indicates that the boat is  less than 1 nm to a boundary (“GPS fix is &lt; 1.0 nm from boundary). Here we have choosen “Any” as the boundary type, so the alarm will get triggered if we get within a distance of 1 nm from any boundary (no matter what type of boundary).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-32a.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In this example we have three boundaries. One is called “Boundary RED SOLID”, one is called “Boundary RED LONG DASH” and the third is called “Boundary RED DOT”. These names are just given as an example and to make things easier to understand (and yes, the names indeed do correspond with the colors and types of the lines).
</p>

<p>
The 4 range rings around the boat are each 0.25 nm, so the outer ring represents a range of 1 nm. You can see that the boat is closer than 1 nm to the boundary “RED SOLID”. The other two boundaries are more than 1 nm from the boat.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the alarm is activated, WD will trigger the alarm and draw a red and grey flashing line to the boundary that is within 1 nm. In this case the screenshot was taken at a moment when that red and grey flashing line was in the “red” state.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-32b.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: it is possible that there are situations when there is more than one boundary within the specified range before the alarm is enabled. Then, the moment you enable the alarm, WD will draw the red and grey flashing line to one of these boundaries. <b>That can be any of them and is not necessarily the boundary closest to you!</b>. An example is given in the next screenshot.
</p>

<p>
Here all three the boundaries are within the range of 1 nm. “RED SOLID” is at a range of about 0.75 nm and closest to the boat. “RED LONG DASH” is second at about 0.85 nm and RED DOT is third and just within the 1 nm range. WD picks one of these three boundaries and in this case he picked the boundary “RED DOT”. But that is not the boundary closest to you!
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-32c.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>B. Creating a Watchdog Boundary Distance alarm “you are <u>inside </u>a boundary” (0.0 nm from a boundary).</b><br/>

Now we will set up a Watchdog Boundary Distance Alarm alarm for when we get <b>inside </b>a boundary. And we want this alarm to be triggered only when we enter a boundary of the type “Exclusion”.
</p>

<p>
Edit the alarm so that the alarm will be triggered when the GPS fix indicates that the boat is inside a boundary of the type “Exclusion” (“GPS fix is &lt; <b>0.0</b>  nm from boundary”).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-33.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The alarm is related to GPS fix &lt; 0.00 nm from boundary. Boundary Type “Exclusion” is ticked. The result is that the alarm will be triggered when the GPS fix indicates that the boat is inside a boundary of that type  
</p>

<p>
Click “OK”.
</p>

<p>
The WD Configuration window shows the alarm we just made. Click “OK”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-34.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Make sure that in the WD window the alarm is ticked (enabled). As the boat is not inside an Exclusion boundary, WD shows “Distance &gt; 0.00 nm” and the alarm is not triggered. Position is outside Exclusion boundary = O.K. = no Boundary Alarm
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-35.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Now lets see if it works….<br/>

Position the boat inside one of the Exclusion boundaries (in this case bottom left).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-36.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Position is inside Exclusion boundary = not O.K. = Boundary Alarm. The alarm is triggered and in the WD window the text turns from black to red (meaning: alarm is triggered). Click “OK” in the Watchman window to acknowledge the alarm. If you position the boat outside an Exclusion boundary, the alarm will not be triggered anymore and in the WD window the text will turn from red back to black (meaning: alarm is not triggered).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-37.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
If you change the position of the boat from outside the Exclusion boundaries to inside one of the Exclusion boundaries (for instance the Exclusion boundary bottom right), the alarm will be triggered again.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-38.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>More than one boundary alarm</b><br/>

You can set up more than one Boundary alarm. In the next screenshot you see that there are two Boundary Alarms available, the top one is “Boundary-Distance”. That is the alarm we have just set up. The other alarm (“Boundary-GUID”) is a Boundary alarm of the type “Anchor Watch”. It is meant to alert you when you get outside a specific boundary. In this case; the top left “green” boundary. In short:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> Position is inside that green boundary = O.K. = alarm is not triggered</li>
<li class="level1"> Position is outside that green boundary = not O.K. = alarm is triggered</li>
</ul>

<p>
The boat is outside that boundary but the alarm is not activated yet (the box is not ticked).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-39.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
That second alarm was set up by repeating the steps for setting up a new Boundary alarm. But that second boundary alarm is configured as explained in the next steps.
</p>

<p>
<b>Creating a Boundary GUID “Anchor Watch” alarm</b>
</p>

<p>
Configuration of the alarm:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-40.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The alarm is related to Anchor Watch Boundary with GUID 79caffff-0c22-4b5f-9d55-856f5e7effff (that is the GUID of the top left green boundary, wich is copied and pasted from the top left boundary. See Boundary Alarm: “Anchor Watch” or “Guard Zone” for the procedure.
</p>

<p>
Now let&#039;s test again:
</p>

<p>
Tick the box “Boundary GUID”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-41.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
As the position of the boat is outside the specified boundary, the alarm will get triggered and the text in the WD window will turn from black to red.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-42.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Now position the boat in the specified “Anchor” area (the top left green boundary). The alarm will not be triggered anymore and in the WD window the text will turn from red back to black (meaning: alarm is not triggered).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-43.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Creating a Boundary Guard Zone Alarm</b><br/>

A Boundary alarm of the type “Guard Zone” is meant to alert you when one or more <b>other</b>  ships are inside a specific boundary. “Guard Zone” alarms are fed by the data from your AIS receiver.
</p>

<p>
Setting up a Guard Zone alarm is similar to setting up a Boundary GUID Anchor Alarm. But instead of “Anchor Watch” you click “Guard Zone” and you put the GUID of the “Guard Zone” Boundary in the field next to “Guard Zone GUID”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-44.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
When the feed from your AIS receiver shows that a AIS-target (= “another ship”) enters the specified Guard Zone, the alarm gets triggered.
</p>

<p>
1. Ship not (yet) in Guard Zone: alarm not triggered.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-45.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
2. Ship enters Guard Zone: Alarm is triggered (and shows ships name and MMSI-number)
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-46.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
3. WD Window text turns red and says “<b>AIS Target in zone</b>”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-47.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
4. Ship leaves Guard Zone: Alarm is not triggered anymore, WD Window text turns black and says “<b>No AIS targets found in zone</b>”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/watchdog_old/s-wdpi-48.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Combination of Boundary Guard Zone Alarm and Boundary Anchor Alarm.</b><br/>

It is possible to assign a Boundary Guard Zone Alarm and a Boundary Anchor Watch Alarm to one and the same boundary. That means that you can let Watchdog alert you when another ship enters your “safe” anchoring area. To achieve this, you use in the Boundary Guard Zone Alarm the same GUID as in the Boundary Anchor Watch Alarm.

<h3>DYNAMIC GUARD ZONES</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The plugin “<b>Draw</b>” was invaluable to begin with, but got even better when it was updated with the possibility to draw a Guard Zone <b><u>that moves with our own ship!</u></b> These Guard Zones differ from normal Boundaries. Not only do they move with your own ship, but they can also be set up to rotate with the ships heading or with the ship&#039;s course over the ground. Let&#039;s call them “<b>Dynamic Guard Zones</b>”.
</p>

<p>
As oDraw works hand in glove with WATCHDOG, these new features in oDraw also affect the way WATCHDOG can be used.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples. In these examples “Guard Zone” is shortened to “GZ”.
</p>

<p>
Let&#039;s assume that our ship has a blind spot. A blind spot is an area around the ship that cannot be directly observed by the helms(wo)man. In this example the blind spot is on the port side and extends from 70 to 90 degrees. But we want to be alerted if any ship (AIS-target that is) enters that blind spot. We can set up Watchdog to do that for us.
</p>

<p>
This is how we do that.
</p>

<p>
First we set up a GZ.
</p>

<p>
Open the Draw Toolbar
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-001.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-001.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-001.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Click “Create GZ”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-002.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-002.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-002.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Set the first point of the GZ roughly abeam on the port side.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-003a.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-003a.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-003a.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Set the second point a bit above and to the right of the first point (<u>clockwise</u>).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-004a.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-004a.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-004a.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The result is some kind of wedge-shaped GZ.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-005.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-005.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-005.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Now you should fine-tune that GZ. Click on the GZ and open the “Properties” tab.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-006.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-006.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-006.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Give your GZ a recognizable name and description. Choose the Colours and Line Width you prefer and fill in the required angles and distances. See the example.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-007.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-007.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-007.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Note: the <b>first</b>  distance is the distance <b>closest</b>  to the boat. Make sure this distance is bigger than 0. In this example the first distance is set to 0.01 NMi or 18.52 meters. The <b>second</b>  distance is the <b>greatest</b>  distance from the boat. In this example that distance is set to 1.25 NMi.
</p>

<p>
As the blind spot extends from 70 to 90 degrees portside, we set the first angle to -95 (- is port, + is starboard) and the second angle to -70. The result is a wedge-shaped GZ that starts at 0.01 NMi, extends to 1.25 NMi and covers 15 degrees.
</p>

<p>
<b>Make sure you put a checkmark at “Rotate with Boat”!!</b>
</p>

<p>
The next step is to set up a Watchdog Guard Zone Alarm for that GZ. <b>The steps to do that are described earlier in this manual.</b>
</p>

<p>
Now we&#039;ll put it to the test.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Highland Challenger</em> is closing in on our portside.

</p>

<p>
but as soon as she challenges our “slice of pie”, Watchdog starts to alert us!
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-009a.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-009a.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-009a.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Some other examples:
</p>

<p>
<b>A GZ that extends from 90 degrees Port to 90 degrees starboard.</b><br/>

The outer perimeter is 1.50 NMi, the inner perimeter is 1.25 NMi. The four range rings around our own ship are set 0.25 NMi apart. <em>Eurocargo Genova</em> is approaching on our port bow. Still more than 1.5 miles away, but she&#039;s a big one and doing almost 20 knots.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-010.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-010.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-010.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Luckily we&#039;ve set up our GZ alarm.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-011.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-011.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-011.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
<b>A “Tri-colour” GZ.</b>
</p>

<p>
Here we have three GZ&#039;s around the ship. One (red) covering the 112.5 degree arc that coincides with the port navigation light, one (green) covering the 112.5 degree arc that coincides with the starboard navigation light and one (white) covering the 135 degree arc that coincides with the stern light. As all of these GZ&#039;s are set up to rotate with the ship&#039;s heading, they could be used to see at one glance whether another ship is in your red, green or white sector (also handy to remind some of us that “starboard is green and port is red”…..). 
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-012.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-012.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-012.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
In this example the sectors range from 0.10 to 0.25 Nmi from our ship. This is how these three GZ&#039;s (Guardzone Port, Guardzone Starboard and Guardzone Stern) are set up:
</p>

<p>
The red sector:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-013.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-013.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-013.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The green sector:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-014.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-014.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-014.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The white sector:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-015.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-015.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-015.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Note that the white sector is set by defining the first angle as 112.50 and the second angle as -112.50 this covers an arc of 135 degrees (360 - 225).
</p>

<p>
<em>Arco Axe</em> is sneaking up on us. GZ “Stern” is activated.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-016.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-016.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-016.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
We really don&#039;t want <em>Arco Axe</em> (or any other axe for that matter….) to hit us in the behind but before she can become a pain in the ass, Watchdog spots her and alerts us.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-017.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-017.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-017.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
You can set up multiple Dynamic Guard Zones and set the alarms for one, some or all of these zones.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/wdpi-gz-018.jpeg" class="media" title="wdpi-gz-018.jpg" alt="wdpi-gz-018.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
(Dynamic) Guard Zone Alarms are in some ways similar to the “AIS Collision Alarm” you can set in OpenCPN (Options-Ships-AIS Targets-CPA Calculation). But they are more versatile.

<h3>ANCHOR ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The Anchor Alarm does not belong to the catgory “Boundary” as it is not related to a boundary. The Anchor Alarm is related to a specific position.
</p>

<p>
The pictures are self-explaining (or at least supposed to be).Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick “Anchor”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-49_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In the “Edit Alarm” window, the latitude and longitude (Lat and Lon) of your ship wil be shown (or to be precise: the Lat and Lon of the “your ship” cursor, so make sure you have a GPS fix!).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-50.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Radius can be set to whatever you like but “0 meters” will of course result in an unwanted amount of alarms. In this example radius is set to 50 meters. Click “OK”. Then the alarm is enabled and the boat is within the radius of 50 meters from the specified position, the alarm is not triggered and the circle showing that radius has a green edge.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-51.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Moving the boat more than the pre-set radius (in this case 50 meters), triggers the alarm. The green edge turns red. The text in the WD window turns red and shows the distance from the specified position.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-52.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>To Stop False Alarms (Hints):</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"> Set the Anchor Alert at the same time and place as the Anchor!  - As close as possible.</li>
<li class="level1"> Set the radius a little larger.</li>
<li class="level1"> Make sure you have set the anchor properly so it is not dragging and there is adequate scope.</li>
<li class="level1"> Anchor out of kelp in good holding ground.</li>
<li class="level1"> Change your anchor location, shallower or deeper, different bottom.</li>
<li class="level1"> Check your GPS NMEA data stream to see if the GPS signal is reasonably constant.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>To check your GPS Data Stream</b><br/>

In the NMEA debug window, do you see changes in the GPS receiver position reported by RMC or GLL messages? You can save this stream as a file using the VDR plugin and inspect it with a Text Editor. Make sure there is no change in position reported by GPS receiver. Look at the RMC lines. The lat and lon fields are constant. EG: “3348.0358” and “15116.9019”. You will need to watch these values for a longer time to see change. Of course, if you cycle the power on the GPS receiver, you may see a change, particularly if the receiver selects a different set of satellites to calculate the position. When this happens, by the way, it is a reminder of the essential limit of GPS positional accuracy. You are getting 3 digits of precision, implying around 6 feet of accuracy. But consumer-grade GPS is generally not repeatably accurate to 6 ft.

<h3>COURSE ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Course Alarm is (of course) meant to alert you when you get off course. The problem with getting off course is that you might end up somewhere where you do not want to be.
</p>

<p>
Setting the Course-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick “Course”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-53_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
You can set the alarm for, for “Port” only, for “Starboard” only or for “Port or Starboard”.
</p>

<p>
Choose “Port” if you only want to be alarmed when you go too far to port. Choose “Starboard” if you only want to be alarmed when you go too far to starboard. Choose “Port or Starboard” if you want to be alarmed when you go either too far to port or too far to starboard.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-54.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Choose how many degrees you want as margin before the alarm is triggered. You can specify the desired course either manually (enter the desired course yourself) or by clicking “Current Course”. In that case Watchdog enters your present COG, as received from your GPS.
</p>

<p>
In this example Watchdog will start barking when you wander more than 20 degrees to port or more than 20 degrees to starboard from a course of 135 degrees.
</p>

<p>
After you are finished editing the alarm, click “OK”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-55.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The “Course Alarm” shows up in the Watchdog Configuration window. Click “OK”.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-56.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Watchdog shows your COG (in this example 168 degrees).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-57.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Tick the checkbox (if it isn&#039;t ticked yet). Watchdog “Course Alarm” is now activated and wil alert you if your course is not between 115 and 155 degrees (135 plus or minus 20 degrees).
</p>

<p>
In the screenshot below the course is somewhere around 005 degrees. As that is (way) off course, the alarm is triggered.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-58.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

</p>

</div>

<h3>SPEED ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Speed-alarm is meant to alert you when your SOG gets below (Underspeed) or above (Overspeed) a specific speed. You can set a limit. That limit is the speed, in knots, you don&#039;t want to get below or above.
</p>

<p>
Setting the Speed-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick “Speed”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-59_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In this example the alarm is set for “Underspeed” and the limit is set to 5 knots. In other words: you want to have an alarm as soon as your speed drops below those 5 knots. But If you are riding bigger waves, your speed can increase momentarily when you surf from the wavetop and decrease momentarily when you have to go “uphill” again. In such cases the Speed Alarm might get triggered with every wave. To prevent that, you can set Watchdog to <b>average</b> your speed. You can set  a slider from 1 second to 120 seconds.
</p>

<p>
In this example the slider is set to 60 seconds. Now Watchdog will only trigger the alarm when your <b>average speed, measured over a period of 60 seconds</b>, will be below 5 knots.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-60-0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-61-0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In this example the boat&#039;s average speed over 60 seconds was 0.6 knots and the limit was set to 5.0 knots. Watchdog shows you “<b>0.6 &lt; 5.0</b>” (0.6 is less than 5.0).
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-62-0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Here we have set <b>two </b>speed-alarms. One for <b>Underspeed </b>and one for <b>Overspeed</b>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-62-01.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
In this screenshot the limit was still 5.0 knots, but the boat&#039;s average speed over 60 seconds was 0.3 knots. The “Underspeed” alarm was triggered and the text turned red. The “Overspeed” alarm did not get triggered and that text remained black.
</p>

<h3>DEADMAN ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Deadman Alarm is meant to alert you (or your crew) when the program suspects you to have fallen asleep, jumped overboard or simply passed away. In other words: when after a given amount of time the program still has not experienced any user input whatsoever. The object is of course to be sure there is still someone on board keeping watch and able to take all the necessary actions. The Deadman alarm stops as soon as any action is taken, for instance a movement of the cursor (mouse). As the Deadman alarm is supposed to prevent you from falling asleep (or to wake you up if you did) the only logical kind of alert for “Deadman” is some form of (<b><u>loud and bloody annoying</u></b>!) sound.
</p>

<p>
Setting the Deadman-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick “Deadman”
</p>

</div>

<h3>NMEA DATA ALARM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In Watchdog you can set NMEA-data-alarms. NMEA stands for National Marine Electronics Association. NMEA data consists of sentences, the first word of which, called a data type, defines the interpretation of the rest of the sentence. Each Data type would have its own unique interpretation and is defined in the NMEA standard. Examples of devices that communicate via NMEA-data with your computer are your GPS receiver and your AIS receiver.
</p>

<p>
In this picture there is a set-up with a GPS receiver and a AIS receiver connected to OpenCPN. Here the GPS is on COM21 and the AIS on COM16.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-67.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>NMEA and your position.</b><br/>

For a chart-plotting program like OpenCPN the most important type of NMEA data is the data defining your position on this globe. These data are provided by your GPS receiver. Without receiving these GPS data, the program won&#039;t know what your actual position is anymore (and there is a fair chance you might not know it either). <b>When, for whatever reason, the flow of NMEA-data from your GPS to OpenCPN stops, that will have major effects on the whole idea of the CPN bit</b> (chartplotting and navigation) <b>of OpenCPN!</b>. Your boat might sail into a Boundary Area you want to stay out of, but the boundary alarm won&#039;t be triggered. The same goes for Anchor Alarm. If you drag your anchor but your GPS has gone on the blink, the alarm won&#039;t be triggered. In short: it&#039;s important to know when you lose your GPS fix. The GPS data are received in a data type beginning with “<b>$</b>” and the letters “<b>GP</b>”. The most important NMEA sentences include the GGA which provides the current Fix data, the RMC which provides the minimum GPS sentences information, and the GSA which provides the Satellite status data.
</p>

<p>
So, if OpenCPN receives <b>$GPGGA</b>, that means it receives a fix from your GPS.
</p>

<p>
<b>Setting up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm (GPS)</b><br/>

Let&#039;s set up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm that warns us when for some reason the GPS fix is lost for more than 10 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Set up a new watchdog alarm, choose “NMEA Data” and click “OK”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-68_0.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Standard “$GPGGA” is set. Set timer to “at least every 10 seconds” and tick the other boxes as per the screenshot below. Click “OK”
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-69.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Now you have your NMEA-alarm set. It will be triggered 10 seconds after OpenCPN stops receiving GGA-sentences.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-70.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>NMEA and the position of other ships</b><br/>

NMEA-data can not only show you where you are, they can also show where other ships are, what their name, callsign, SOG and COG are etc. Nice to know if you want to meet up (a rendezvous) or if you are afraid one of them might get a bit too close for comfort (a collision). These kind of data are received via an AIS receiver.
</p>

<p>
<b>Multiple NMEA alarms</b><br/>

You can set a separate alarm for the loss of AIS data. It works the same as the GPS alarm but AIS data (from other ships) always begin with !AIVDM (don&#039;t forget the exclamation-mark).
</p>

<p>
<b>Setting up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm (GPS)</b><br/>

You can add a new NMEA-alarm (see the previous steps) but now you fill in <b>!AIVDM</b>
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-71.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The result is two NMEA Data-alarms (one for GPS fix and one for AIS-data)
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-72.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The upper NMEA Data alarm is the AIS-alarm. The lower NMEA Data alarm is the GPS alarm.
</p>

<p>
Each alarm can be switched on or off.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-73.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

</div>

<h3>EMAIL TO YOURSELF</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
You can order Watchdog to execute a computer command. Let&#039;s say that we want Watchdog to send us an email in case our anchor drags. We have stored that command in a file we made and called <b>AnchorAlarm.bat</b>. In this example that file is stored in the root of our computer (C:\) but of course you can put in anywhere, as long as you tell Watchdog where to find it.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-04aa.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Sending emails from the command prompt can be done with a small tool called “Send-It-Quiet”. More info: <a href="http://commandlinesendmail.blogspot.nl/" class="urlextern" title="http://commandlinesendmail.blogspot.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://commandlinesendmail.blogspot.nl/</a>
</p>

<p>
Example of the file AnchorAlarm.bat (in this example Send-It-Quiet is installed in E:\Tools\senditquiet\senditquiet)
</p>

<p>
Lets say:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"> You are Blackbeard</li>
<li class="level1"> Your emailadress is <b>blackbeard@gmail.com</b></li>
<li class="level1"> Your Gmail username is <b>blackbeard</b></li>
<li class="level1"> Your Gmail password is <b>1loveGold2</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You want the program to send an email to yourself with the subject <b>ANCHOR ALARM</b> and the message <b>This is your ship. You stupid fool, come back here! My anchor is dragging!</b>
</p>

<p>
The batchfile would then be:
</p>

<p>
E:\Tools\senditquiet\senditquiet\senditquiet.exe -s smtp.gmail.com -port 587 -u <b>blackbeard@gmail.com</b>  -protocol ssl -p <b>1loveGold2</b>  -f <b>blackbeard@gmail.com</b>  -t <b>blackbeard@gmail.com</b>  -subject “<b>ANCHOR ALARM</b>” -body “<b>This is your ship. You stupid fool, come back here! My anchor is dragging!</b>”
</p>

<p>
The result when the anchor alarm gets triggered…
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../opencpn/manual/plugins/watchdog/s-wdpi-04b.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> Of course this only works when you can actually email from the computer OpenCPN is installed on! This example is tested on a Windows 7 PC with Internet connection and a Gmail-account.
</p>

<p>
If, after reading all of the above, you still wonder why Watchdog could be of any use for navigation, we strongly advise you to sell your boat.
