<p>
Many countries around the maritime world are testing the AIS binary messages.  Expect a lot of development in this area.
</p>

<p>
In OpenCPN, this is very much a work in progress, the areas were only added April 2012 and the messages in December 2012.
</p>

<p>
Areas and the messages included for each area, are available.
In the US, Cape Cod is transmitting experimental Right Whale information.  For testing, copy <a href="http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm" class="urlextern" title="http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm" rel="nofollow">vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm</a> into a text file and point the VDR (Voyage Data Recording) plugin to this file.
These messages are updated quite often.

<p>
The area messages are found as the first entries in a normal object query for vectorcharts.  The easiest way to display this dialog is to just double click in an area.  The screen picture above shows that this works for RNC:s (raster charts) as well as ENC:s (vector charts).  The first notice above is for the yellow tinted rectangular area while he second notice is for one of the circles outlined in green.

<b>An overview of available massages compiled by IALA.</b>
IALA has agreed to maintain a collection of regional applications for the AIS Application Specific Messages that are in use.  The intent is to provide an overview to all interested parties of what currently exists.
