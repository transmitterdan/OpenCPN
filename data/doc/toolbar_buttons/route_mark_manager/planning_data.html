<h3>Need to see some offshore weather observations?</h3>
<div class="level3">

See online  <a href="..\..\2owiki.html">Owiki</a>

<p>
NOAAs <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ship_obs.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ship_obs.php" rel="nofollow">NDBC site</a> gives access to a lot of offshore observations from buoys and ships worldwide.
</p>

<p>
To easily visualize all this data the “ShipWxRep” script transform a limited set of all the available data into gpx waypoints. The format, as seen above is “wind direction, wind speed, time for observation, and air pressure”. This can be helpful when evaluating the accuracy of grib files, even though the best tool in this respect probably is a calibrated digital barometer.

<h3>Plotting Miami Tropical Forecast Advisories.</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
If you only have access to low bandwidth Internet, this script is a way to quickly plot the contents of, for example, an email containing the forecast advisory. In any case, it is a good idea to have the forecast track of a tropical system available where you normally do your navigation and planning.
