<div class="level3">

<p>
Welcome! This is the Documentation for the OpenCPN 4.4.0 stable release.
It is very easy and intuitive to get started with OpenCPN. The different menus, including the clever context-sensitive right-click menu, make it likely that you will find what you need. The program contains a lot of options to fit users with special demands and hardware.

<h3>HELP, FAQ &amp; OpenCPN User Manual</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The most frequently asked questions by new users, seen in the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134" class="urlextern" title="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134" rel="nofollow">OpenCPN Forum</a>, are, in most cases, already answered in the <b><u>OpenCPN USER MANUAL</u></b>. If you are going to use this program for actual navigation, you need to read through this document to fully understand the scope of the program, as well as all the details.
</p>

<p>
If you have difficulties finding a particular subject, please <b>use your browser&#039;s built-in search ability</b>, often called just “<b>Find</b>”. This works best using the stable release which is all on one web page.
</p>

<p>
In the Program “OpenCPN” Press <img src="opencpn/manual/help.h.25_tok.1099a9_w.25.png" class="media" alt="" width="25" height="25" /> and then the <b>Help Tab</b> to access the built-in version of this document.  The installed documentation will open in your default browser. <b>This is the first place to go for help, read the documentation please</b>.  To download a current snapshot of this wiki as one huge web page, <a href="towebsite.html" class="wikilink2" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:fullindex" rel="nofollow">Click here for fullindex</a> (only works if you are online).

<li class="level1"> External links may be <b>Bold</b>, <u>Underlined</u>, or in the “http:/\…” format and need an Internet connection.</li>

<h3>Copy Settings File &amp; Log File to Clipboard</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
If you encounter difficulties in using OpenCPN you may be asked to submit your <b>Settings File</b> and/or your <b>Log File</b>. This data will help the developers to diagnose your problem. 
</p>

<p>
To locate these files, in the program “OpenCPN” Press <img src="opencpn/manual/help.h.25_tok.1099a9_w.25.png" class="media" alt="" width="25" height="25" /> and then the <b>About Tab</b> and two tabs will show as shown below:
</p>

<span class='np_break'>&nbsp;</span>
<div class="table sectionedit1"><table class="inline">
	<tr class="row0">
		<td class="col0">Copy Settings File to Clipboard </td><td class="col1 leftalign"> Copy Log File to Clipboard  </td><td class="col2 rightalign">  Donate </td>
	</tr>
</table>
<span class='np_break'>&nbsp;</span>
</div>
<p>
Use these tabs for an easy way to copy these files, and then paste the clipboard contents to a document and attach it to a Cruiser&#039;s Forum post.
</p>

<p>
As you can see above, <img src="opencpn/manual/help.h.24_tok.ce6ec6_w.24.png" class="media" alt="" width="24" height="24" /> also documents the people contributing to OpenCPN and a copy of the license OpenCPN uses, GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2. We are always looking for volunteers.
