# Handling Communications Messages in Plugins

Since TBD, opencpn has a new system for handling messages in plugins. The new
model is based on that a plugin subscribes to the messages it is interested
in rather then the old model where plugins get all messages.

The new system is the only way to handle the new NMEA2000 devices. For N0183
devices a compatiblity layer is installed which makes things work as earlier.
However, the new system can be used also for nmea0183 where it offers more
flexibility and performance.

Handling of messages consists of six steps:

1. Define the type of message to work with
2. Declare a listening object.
3. Declare an event which will carry the message.
4. Declare a method which handles the message.
5. Subscribe to this message i. e., start listening to it
6. Handle the messages as they arrives.


All in all, an example could be like this:

First, declare a listener on the class level, here with the shipdriver
plugin _ShipDriver_pi.h_ header as an example:

        class ShipDriver_pi : public opencpn_plugin_118 {
        public:
            ShipDriver_pi(void* ppimgr);
            ~ShipDriver_pi(void);
            ...
        private:
     ②      std::shared_ptr<ObservedVarListener> listener;
            ...

Then declare a method which handles the message, something like this:

     ④ void HandleGPGA(ObservedEvt ev) {
     ①      NMEA0183 id("GPGGA");
            std::string payload = GetN0183Payload(id, ev)
            ...

Then, in the constructor set up the listening:

         ShipDriver_pi::ShipDriver_pi(void* ppimgr)
         : opencpn_plugin_116(ppimgr)
         {
         ...
     ①   NMEA0183Id id("GPGGA");
     ③   wxDEFINE_EVENT(EVT_SHIPDRIVER, ObservedEvt);
     ⑤   listener = GetListener(id, EVT_SHIPDRIVER, this);
     ⑥   Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER [](ObservedEvt ev) { HandleGPGA(ev); });

Notes:

①:: This is the type of message we are listening to. There are similar types
    for NMEA2000 , SignalK and decoded navigation data (lat, long, etc.)

②:: Boiler-plate code, makes sure the listener is destroyed together with
    the plugin. It is important that the listener is declared in the class,
    a variable defined in a method will not work.

③:: This the event generated for our message which we will listen to. It should
    have an unique name, including the plugin name is a good habit. However
    the name, here _EVT_SHIPDRIVER_, could be anything.

④:: The `GetN0183Payload()` method  gets the payload of the message into the
    `payload` string. From here it can be processed as required.

⑤:: This activates the listener. From this points system sends us an
    _EVT_SHIPDRIVER_ for each received GPGGA message.

⑥:: This is the final piece in the puzzle. It defines what should happen when
    the _EVT_SHIPDRIVER_ arrives.  From this point all incoming GPGGA
    messages will land in the `HandleGPGGA()` method and be processed.


## Epilog: Using the lambda

The last step above was
`Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER [](wxCommandEvent ev) { HandleGPGA(ev); })`. The part
between the curly braces is actually a C++ lambda expression. There is no
need to dive into this to get something running, but it offers far larger
possibilities than to just call a function. Actually, if written like
`Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER [&](wxCommandEvent ev) { ... })` any code could
be written between the braces.

The interesting part here is that the `[&]` prefix makes this code "see"
anything defined in the plugin. This is a convenient way to access plugin
variables in the handler, something which otherwise is a problem.

To get the feeling one need to experiment. But then again, C++ lambdas
is a complex step which is not necessary to get something running.
