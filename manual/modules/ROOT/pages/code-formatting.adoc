= Code Formatting

== C/C++

After resolving https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1118[Bug 1118]
and https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/2357[Bug 2357] the sources
have a uniform coding formatting based on the
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Formatting[Google Style].

The style is also defined in the _.clang-format_ file which when used
by https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html[clang-format] produces a
correctly formatted source file.

Some short notes:

  - Indentation: two spaces per level, no hard tabs.
  - The two-spaces indentation also applies to headers despite standard
    Google style here is one space.
  - 80 characters max line length.
  - Unix-style lf line endings are used in the git repository.
  - No trailing space or hard tabs in sources.
  - Sources should use 7-bit ascii. Use  for example "\x00b0" rather than "Â°"

== CMake

Cmake file uses formatting defined by the _.cmake-format.yaml_ which when used
with https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format[cmake-format] produces
correctly formatted files. This has been applied to all _cmake/*.cmake_ files
and CMakeLists.txt.

== Using clang-format

clang is part of the llvm tools. These are usually installed using package
managers like choco (Windows), brew (MacOS) or apt (Debian/Ubuntu).

To format a C, C++ or header file with clang-format with the project's default 
configuration use:

    clang-format -i  <filename>

== Using  cmake-format

Install cmake-format as described in
https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format[]. To format a single file use

    cmake-format -i  <filename>

== Using the git pre-commit hook

The standard git pre-commit hook avoids committing trailing whitespace, bogus
line-endings etc. It needs to be activated by

    cp .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit

Windows users uses `copy` instead of `cp`. Using the hook is strongly
recommended.

== Editor and IDE configuration

There is an https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1416[open bug] for
creating an _.editorconfig_ file.  This file could be used by most
editors to define basic settings.

There are no standard configurations available for IDEs like Visual Studio
Code, Eclipse or CLion.
