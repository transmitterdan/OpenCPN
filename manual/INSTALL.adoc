= Building the development manual

This document describes the basic steps to build the manual locally.
The official, published version is available at
https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/main/

Local builds requires Nodejs installed. See for example
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or use package managers
like apt or dnf on linux.

With nodejs in place, build using

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build

The resulting website is placed in the directory _docs_. Check the
results by pointing the browser to the _docs/index.html_ file.
